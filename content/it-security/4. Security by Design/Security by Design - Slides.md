## What is Security by Design?

- Proactive cybersecurity approach.
- Integrates security into every development phase.
- Creates inherently secure systems.

---
## Key Principles of Security by Design

- Foundational Principles

    1. **Proactive Security Measures**
    2. **Least Privilege**
    3. **Secure Defaults**
    4. **Fail-Safe Defaults**

---
## Key Principles of Security by Design

- Proactive Security Measures

    - Integrate security early in development.
    - Identify and mitigate risks initially.
    - Prioritize security from the outset.

---
## Key Principles of Security by Design

- Least Privilege

    - Grant minimal access necessary.
    - Reduce impact of compromised accounts.

---
## Key Principles of Security by Design

- Secure Defaults

    - Configure secure settings by default.
    - Minimize need for user adjustments.
    - Prevent vulnerabilities from misconfigurations.

---
## Key Principles of Security by Design

- Fail-Safe Defaults

    - Systems fail securely.
    - Prevent unauthorized access on failure.

---
## Key Principles of Security by Design

- Architectural Strategies

    1. **Defense in Depth**
    2. **Minimize Attack Surface**
    3. **Modular Design**
    4. **Secure Communication Channels**

---
## Key Principles of Security by Design
