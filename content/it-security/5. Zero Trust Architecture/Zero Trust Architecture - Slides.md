## What is Zero Trust Architecture?

- **Never Trust, Always Verify**
- Strict verification for every access request

---

## Foundational Principles

- **Never Trust, Always Verify**
- **Least Privilege Access**
- **Microsegmentation**

---

## Never Trust, Always Verify

- Assume threats inside and outside the network
- Authenticate, authorize, and encrypt every access
- Continuous verification for all users and devices

---

## Least Privilege Access

- Grant minimum necessary permissions
- Reduces impact of compromised accounts
- Limits access to sensitive data and systems

---

## Microsegmentation

- Divide network into isolated segments
- Limits lateral movement of attackers
- Each segment has its own security controls

---

## Architectural Strategies

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Continuous Monitoring and Analytics**

---

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- Manages user identities and access
- Ensures only authorized users access resources
- Integrates authentication and authorization

---

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Adds extra verification layers
- Combines passwords with tokens or biometrics
- Enhances security against compromised credentials

---

## Continuous Monitoring and Analytics

- Real-time surveillance of activities
- Detects and responds to anomalies
- Utilizes advanced analytics and machine learning

---

## Operational Tactics

- **Endpoint Security**
- **Encryption and Data Protection**

---

## Endpoint Security

- Protects all devices accessing the network
- Uses Antivirus, Anti-Malware
- Ensures device compliance before access

---

## Encryption and Data Protection

- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Protects sensitive information from interception
- Ensures data remains unreadable without keys

---

## Conclusion

- **Advanced IT:** Protects against evolving cyber threats
