## What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)?

- Framework of policies, technologies, and processes
- Often implemented by Cloud Providers

---

## Foundational Principles

- **Authentication**
- **Authorization**
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**

---

## Governance Strategies

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
- **Policy Management**

---

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Assigns permissions based on roles
- Simplifies access management
- Ensures consistent policy enforcement

---

## Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

- Grants access based on user attributes
- More granular and dynamic control
- Flexible compared to RBAC

---

## Policy Management

- Defines and enforces access policies
- Policies can be applied to both users and systems

---

## Operational Tactics

- **Provisioning and De-Provisioning**
- **Audit and Monitoring**

---

## Provisioning and De-Provisioning

- Automates granting and revoking access
- Ensures appropriate access lifecycle
- Reduces risk of orphaned accounts

---

## Audit and Monitoring

- Tracks user activities and access
- Detects and responds to suspicious behavior
- Ensures compliance with policies

---

## The Components of IAM

1. **Identity Repository**
2. **Authentication Mechanisms**
3. **Authorization Frameworks**
4. **Provisioning and De-Provisioning Systems**
5. **Audit and Compliance Tools**

---

## Identity Repository

- Centralized database for user identities
- Stores credentials and attributes
- Ensures scalable and secure management

---

## Authorization Mechanisms

- **RBAC:** Role-based permissions
- **ABAC:** Attribute-based permissions
- **ACLs:** Access control lists

---

## Provisioning and De-Provisioning Systems

- Automates access lifecycle
- Manages user roles and permissions

---

## Audit and Compliance Tools

- **Activity Logging:** Records user actions
- **Usage Monitoring:** Tracks resource usage
- **Audit Trails:** Forensic event records

---
## Conclusion

- **Cornerstone of Cybersecurity:** Manages digital identities and access
- **Enhances Security and Compliance:** Ensures only authorized access
- **Supports Operational Efficiency:** Centralizes and automates access processes
- **Compliance:** Meets regulatory standards like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS
