## What is Defense in Depth?

- A cybersecurity strategy using multiple security layers.
- Protects data, systems, and networks.
- Ensures no single point of failure.

---

## Key Principles of Defense in Depth

1. **Layered Security**
2. **Redundancy**
3. **Diversity of Controls**
4. **Proactive and Reactive Measures**

---

## Layered Security

- Implement multiple, independent security layers.
- Each layer addresses different threats.
- Enhances overall protection.

---

## Redundancy

- Failover mechanisms in place.
- Backup systems to maintain security.
- Prevents exposure if one layer fails.

---

## Diversity of Controls

- Use various defense types: firewalls, encryption, authentication.
- Avoid reliance on a single technology.
- Reduces vulnerability to specific attacks.

---

## Proactive and Reactive Measures

- Combine prevention with detection and response.

---

## The Layers of Defense in Depth

1. Data Layer
2. Application Layer
3. Host Layer
4. Network Layer
5. Perimeter Layer
6. Physical Layer
7. Policies, Procedures, and Awareness Layer

---

## Data Layer

- **Key Measures:**
  - Data encryption (at rest and in transit).
  - Access controls (RBAC, ABAC).
  - Backup and recovery solutions.

---

## Application Layer

- **Key Measures:**
  - Secure coding practices.
  - Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS.
  - Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).

- **Advanced Measures:**
  - Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Systems.

---

## Host Layer

- **Key Measures:**
  - Antivirus and anti-malware tools.
  - Operating system hardening.

- **Advanced Measures:**
  - File Integrity Monitoring (FIM).
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.

---

## Network Layer

- **Key Measures:**
  - Firewalls.
  - Network segmentation.
  - Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

- **Advanced Measures:**
  - Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).
  - DNS security (e.g., DNSSEC).

---

## Perimeter Layer

- **Key Measures:**
  - Perimeter firewalls and proxies.
  - Demilitarized Zones (DMZs) for public-facing services.

- **Advanced Measures:**
  - DDoS mitigation solutions.

---

## Physical Layer

- **Key Measures:**
  - Access controls (keycards, biometrics).
  - Surveillance systems (CCTV).
  - Environmental controls (fire suppression).

- **Additional Measures:**
  - Secure hardware disposal processes.

---

## Policies, Procedures, and Awareness Layer

- **Key Measures:**
  - Security awareness training for employees.
  - Incident response and disaster recovery plans.
  - Regular audits and compliance checks.

- **Additional Measures:**
  - Defined security policies and governance frameworks.

---

## Conclusion

- Defense in Depth offers a holistic IT security approach.
- Combines technical, procedural, and human measures.
- Enhances resilience against diverse cyber threats.
