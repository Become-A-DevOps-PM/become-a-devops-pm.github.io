## Inside a Physical Server
- Physical servers are engineered for reliability and heavy workloads.
- Components work together to host applications, store data, and process tasks.
---
## Core Components
- **CPU**: Executes instructions and manages tasks.
- **RAM**: Temporary storage for active processes and data.
- **Storage Drives**: Persistent data storage.
- **Motherboard**: Central communication hub.
- **PSU**: Converts power for server use.
- **Cooling Systems**: Maintains optimal temperatures.
- **NICs**: Handles network connectivity.
- **Expansion Slots**: Adds versatility for specialized components.
---
## CPU
- The "brain" of the server.
- Multicore processors for parallel task handling.
- Examples: Intel Xeon, AMD EPYC.
---
## RAM
- Temporarily holds active data for faster processing.
- Affects server speed and multitasking.
- Often uses ECC (Error-Correcting Code) for reliability.
---
## Storage Drives
- Types: HDD (capacity) and SSD (speed).
- Supports RAID for redundancy and performance.
- Stores applications and persistent data.
---
## Motherboard
- Main circuit board connecting all components.
- Includes CPU socket, RAM slots, and storage interfaces.
- Facilitates data communication.
---
## Power Supply Unit (PSU)
- Converts power to server-compatible voltage.
- Often redundant for reliability.
- Efficiency ratings (e.g., 80 PLUS) show energy efficiency.
---
## Cooling Systems
- Prevent overheating of components.
- Includes fans, heat sinks, or liquid cooling.
- Adjusts dynamically using built-in sensors.
---
## Network Interface Card (NIC)
- Connects servers to networks.
- Speeds range from 1 Gbps to 40 Gbps.
- Integrated or added via expansion cards.
---
## Expansion Slots
- PCIe slots for GPUs, additional NICs, etc.
- USB and other ports for maintenance.
- Increases server functionality.
---
## Physical Server Design
- Built for 24/7 operation.
- **Hot-Swappable Components**: Replacements without downtime.
- **Rack-Mountable Chassis**: Fits organized server racks.
- **Management Interfaces**: Tools like IPMI and iLO for remote monitoring.
