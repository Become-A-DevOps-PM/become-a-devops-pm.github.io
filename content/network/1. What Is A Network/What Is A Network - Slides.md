## What is a Network?
- **Connectivity**: Enables communication paths between devices and networks.
- **Data Transmission**: Transfers data using routing (inter-network) and switching (intra-network).
- **Protocols**: Ensure data is transmitted correctly and securely (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).
- **Security**: Implements firewalls, encryption, and access controls to protect data.

## Key Network Components
- **Routers**: Direct data between networks; use IP addresses to forward packets.
- **Switches**: Manage data within local networks based on MAC addresses.
- **Firewalls**: Monitor and control traffic using security rules.
- **Wireless Access Points**: Connect wireless devices to a wired network.
- **Intermediaries**: Load balancers, reverse proxies, and bastion hosts enhance performance and security.

---

## Network Topologies
- **Bus**: Shared communication line; cost-effective but limited performance.
- **Star**: Devices connect to a central hub; isolates faults effectively.
- **Ring**: Circular connection; efficient but can fail without redundancy.
- **Mesh**: Multiple connections; highly reliable but costly.
- **Hybrid**: Combines topologies for specific needs.

---

## Levels of Abstraction
- **Physical Layer**: Hardware like cables, switches and routers.
- **Virtual Network Layer**: Isolated network segments (e.g., VLANs, VPNs).
- **Cloud Network Layer**: Managed solutions like Azure VNets and AWS VPCs.
- **Serverless Networking**: Automated routing and scaling by cloud providers.

---

## Network Security
- **Firewalls**: Block unauthorized access.
- **Encryption**: Protects data in transit.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitor for suspicious activity.
