## What are Network Intermediaries?
- Devices or software that manage data flow between network devices.
- Enhance performance, security and availability.

---

## Types of Network Intermediaries
1. **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
2. **Reverse Proxies**: Intercept client requests and forward them to backend servers.
3. **Gateways**: Translate protocols between different network types.
4. **Bastion Hosts**: Provide secure access to private networks.

---

## Load Balancers
- Improve availability and performance by evenly distributing network traffic.
- Operate at Layer 4 (Transport) or Layer 7 (Application) of the OSI model.

---

## Reverse Proxies
- Enhance security by hiding backend infrastructure.
- Provide features like SSL termination, caching, and request filtering.

---

## Gateways
- Act as bridges between different networks or systems.
- Examples: VPN gateways, API gateways.

---

## Bastion Hosts
- Secure access point for administrators managing private resources.
- Typically hardened with additional security measures.
