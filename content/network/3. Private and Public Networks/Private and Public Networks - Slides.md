## Private and Public Networks
- Networks are categorized as **private** or **public** based on their accessibility.
- This distinction plays a key role in networking and security design.

---

## What is a Private Network?
- The concept of non-routable IP addresses
- Often used in organizational or home environments.
- Example: **192.168.0.0/16**, **10.0.0.0/8**, **172.16.0.0/12** (RFC 1918 ranges).

---

## What is a Public Network?
- Accessible to any device with internet access.
- Used for global communication and resource sharing.
- Example: Public IPs assigned by ISPs, like **8.8.8.8** (Google DNS).

---

## Key Differences
- **Accessibility**: Private networks are restricted (non-routable), public networks are open.
- **IP Range**: Private IPs are non-routable on the internet; public IPs are globally unique.
- **Security**: Private networks have built-in isolation; public networks require additional security measures.

---

## Use Cases
- **Private Networks**:
  - Home Wi-Fi, corporate LANs, or cloud VNets.
  - Ideal for internal communications and sensitive data.
- **Public Networks**:
  - Websites, cloud services, or global applications.
  - Enables internet-wide connectivity.

---

## Practical Considerations
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**:
  - Translates private IPs to public IPs for internet access.
  - Common in home and corporate setups.
- **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**:
  - Secure communication over public networks.
  - Extends private networks securely.

---

## Benefits of Private Networks
- Enhanced security and control.
- Reduced risk of external cyber threats.

---

## Benefits of Public Networks
- Unlimited accessibility and reach.
- Essential for public-facing services and applications.
