## Overview

The objective of this exercise is to create a Virtual Network (vNet) with a subnet secured by a Network Security Group (NSG) attached to the subnet itself. You will also provision three servers with specific roles: Web Server, Reverse Proxy, and Bastion Host. Application Security Groups (ASGs) will be configured for the Reverse Proxy and Bastion Host, and all server configurations will be automated using **cloud-init**.

### Step 1: Log in to Azure Portal

1. Open [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).  
2. Sign in with your Azure account credentials.

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Network 
1. In the Azure Portal, use the search bar at the top to search for **"Virtual Networks"**.  
2. Select **Virtual Networks** from the search results or from the left menu
3. Click the **+ Create** button at the top of the Virtual Networks page.  
4. On the **Basics** tab, fill in the following information:  
   - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.  
   - **Resource Group**: Choose an existing resource group or create a new one (e.g., `DemoRG`).  
   - **Name**: Enter `DemoVNet`.  
   - **Region**: Choose a region close to your location (e.g., `North Europe`).  
5. Click **Review + Create** and then click Create to deploy the Virtual Network.  

### Step 3: Create Application Security Groups

1. In the Azure Portal, search for **Application Security Groups**.  
2. Create two ASGs:
	
	Reverse Proxy:
	
   - **Name**: `ReverseProxyASG`
   - **Resource Group**: `DemoRG`

	Bastion Host:
	
   - **Name**: `BastionHostASG `
   - **Resource Group**: `DemoRG`

### Step 4: Create a Network Security Group and Rules

1. In the Azure Portal, search for **Network Security Groups**.  
2. Click **+ Create** and provide the following information:  
   - **Name**: `DemoNSG`.  
   - **Resource Group**: Select `DemoRG`.  
   - **Region**: Choose the same region as the VNet.  
3. Got to resource and add inbound security rules:

	- Go to **Settings -> Inbound security rules**

	SSH:
	
	- Source: Service Tag
	- Source service tag: Internet
	- Destination: Application security group
	- Destination application security group: BastionHostASG
	- Service: SSH
	- Click **Add**

	HTTP:
	
	- Source: Service Tag
	- Source service tag: Internet
	- Destination: Application security group
	- Destination application security group: ReverseProxyASG
	- Service: HTTP
	- Click **Add**
   
4. Attach the NSG to the `default` subnet in the VNet.

	- Go to **Settings -> Subnets**
	- Click **+ Associate** and select
		- Virtual network: DemoVNet
		- Subnet: default

### Step 5: Provision VMs and Configure with Cloud-Init  
1. Create three VMs using the following specifications:  
   - **VM Names**: `WebServer`, `ReverseProxy`, `BastionHost`.  
   - **Image**: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS.  
   - **Size**: `Standard_B1s`.  
   - **Subnet**: Use `default`.  
   - **Public IP**: Attach only to the Bastion Host and the Reverse Proxy.  
   - **NSG**: Leave **None** for all NICs.  
   - **ASG**: Attach `ReverseProxyASG` to the Reverse Proxy and `BastionHostASG` to the Bastion Host.

   - **WebServer (`cloud-config`)**:

		```yaml
		#cloud-config
		packages:
		  - nginx
		write_files:
		  - path: /var/www/html/index.html
		    content: |
		      <!DOCTYPE html>
		      <html>
		      <head>
		          <title>Hello World!</title>
		      </head>
		      <body>
		          <h1>Hello World!</h1>
		      </body>
		      </html>
		  - path: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
		    content: |
		      server {
		        listen 8080 default_server;
		        server_name _;
		        root /var/www/html;
		        index index.html;
		      }
		runcmd:
		  - systemctl restart nginx
		```

   - **ReverseProxy (`cloud-config`)**:

		```yaml
		#cloud-config
		packages:
		  - nginx
		write_files:
		  - path: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
		    content: |
		      server {
		        listen 80;
		        location / {
		          proxy_pass http://webserver.internal.cloudapp.net:8080/;
		          proxy_set_header Host $host;
		          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		        }
		      }
		runcmd:
		  - systemctl restart nginx
		```

### Test and Verify

This chapter ensures the Virtual Network (VNet), Network Security Group (NSG), and Virtual Machines (VMs) are configured correctly and functioning as intended. Follow these steps to verify each aspect of the setup:

#### 1. **Verify NSG Rules**

- Navigate to the **DemoNSG** in the Azure Portal.
- Check the inbound security rules:
  - SSH is allowed only for the `BastionHostASG`.
  - HTTP traffic is allowed only for the `ReverseProxyASG`.
- Confirm that the NSG is associated with the `default` subnet in the VNet.

> ✅ **Verification Step**:
> - Attempt SSH access from the Internet to the Web Server or Reverse Proxy. This should fail.
> - Attempt HTTP access to the Web Server directly. This should fail.
> - Attempt HTTP access to the Reverse Proxy. This should succeed.

#### 2. **Check Application Security Groups**

- Ensure the Application Security Groups (ASGs) are correctly associated:
  - `ReverseProxyASG` is assigned to the Reverse Proxy VM.
  - `BastionHostASG` is assigned to the Bastion Host VM.

> ✅ **Verification Step**:
> - Navigate to the **Networking** section of the Reverse Proxy and Bastion Host VMs.
> - Confirm the ASGs are listed under **Application Security Groups**.

#### 3. **Test HTTP Access to Reverse Proxy**

- Open a browser or use a tool like `curl` to access the Reverse Proxy's public IP on port `80`.
- Verify that the Reverse Proxy forwards traffic to the Web Server using its internal DNS name.

> **Command**:
> 
> ```bash
> curl http://<ReverseProxy_PublicIP>
> ```
>
> **Expected Output**:
> - The HTTP response displays the content of the Web Server's `index.html` page with the message:  **Hello World!**

#### 4. **Test Internal Communication**

- Use the Bastion Host to SSH into the Reverse Proxy using the private IP address.
- From the Reverse Proxy, test internal DNS resolution and HTTP connectivity to the Web Server.

> **Commands**:
> 
> ```bash
> ssh azureuser@<BastionHost_PublicIP>
> curl http://webserver.internal.cloudapp.net:8080
> ```
>
> **Expected Output**:
> 
> - The DNS name `webserver.internal.cloudapp.net` resolves to the Web Server.
> - The HTTP response from the Web Server shows the `index.html` page with the message: **Hello World!**

#### 5. **Verify Security Configuration**

- Confirm that:
  - SSH is accessible only via the Bastion Host.
  - HTTP traffic to the Web Server is routed only through the Reverse Proxy.
  - Direct Internet access to the Web Server is blocked.

#### Summary of Verification Steps

- **NSG and Subnet**: Ensure the NSG is applied correctly to the subnet, restricting access as per rules.
- **ASG Configuration**: Verify the ASGs are correctly assigned to the Reverse Proxy and Bastion Host.
- **Internal DNS**: Validate that the Reverse Proxy uses the Web Server’s internal DNS name for communication.
- **Cloud-Init Automation**: Ensure the Web Server and Reverse Proxy are configured correctly via `cloud-config` without manual intervention.
